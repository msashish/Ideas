# Life concepts

1) Radioactive stone and life seems to have similarities.
   Both change over time, radiate energy.
   difference is that life takes energy too.

2) Think of life as a thread/stream of focussed vibration
   On this thread, we have other vinrations.
   its hence a science of vibrating layer over layer
   Deviations are what we feel

3) No two things or events in life are equal.
   Two apples are not equal and will have some difference
   Twins are not equal
